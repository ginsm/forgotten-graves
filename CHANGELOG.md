# 3.2.22

Supports Minecraft versions: `1.20-1.20.4`

## Added
- Added support for mods that add Soulbound enchants (Ender Zoology, Soulbound, etc) ([#119](https://github.com/ginsm/forgotten-graves/issues/119)).
  - Note: Curse of Vanishing overrides Soulbound; items with both will still vanish.
- Added support for Botania's Resolute Ivy ([#117](https://github.com/ginsm/forgotten-graves/issues/117)).
- Added enchantment tags for better compatibility:
  - `binding_curses`
  - `vanishing_curses`
  - `soulbound_enchants`
